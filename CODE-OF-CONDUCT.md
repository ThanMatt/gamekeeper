# GameKeeper Code of Conduct

## TL;DR: Don't be a jerk ðŸŽ²

We're all here because we love board games and want to make cool tools together. Let's keep it fun
and welcoming for everyone.

## The Rules

**Be Cool** ðŸ˜Ž

- Treat everyone with respect
- Help newcomers learn
- Focus on the code, not the person
- All skill levels and frameworks welcome

**Don't Be That Person** ðŸš«

- No harassment, trolling, or personal attacks
- No gatekeeping or dismissing ideas without reason
- Keep discussions appropriate and constructive

## When Things Go Wrong

If someone's being uncool, try talking to them directly first. If that doesn't work, reach out to
the maintainers. We'll handle issues fairly but won't hesitate to remove people who make the
community worse.

## Board Game Spirit

Treat others how you'd want to be treated during a long game night - with patience, respect, and
good humor.
